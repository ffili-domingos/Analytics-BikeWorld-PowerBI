# Overview

Bike World started operating in July 2017 in the bicycle industry, offering a broad product range including bikes, components, clothing, and accessories.
This project analyzes sales from July 2017 to June 2020, a period that captures both the company’s early growth stage and its international expansion.

During these three years, Bike World sold products in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

The company follows a hybrid distribution model:
- direct-to-consumer sales
- reseller sales

This approach increases market reach, diversifies revenue streams, and reduces dependence on a single channel.

The goal of this project is to turn raw transactional data into useful business insights.
The analysis focuses on four main areas:
- sales performance
- geographic expansion
- product strategy
- channel optimization

# Recommendations

## Focus on high-performing products

A large share of revenue comes from a small number of products, mainly Mountain Bikes and Road Bikes.
- increase marketing and online visibility for these products
- review low-performing items, especially clothing and accessories
- consider bundles or catalog reduction to lower inventory costs
- use upselling and cross-selling for premium models and related accessories

## Improve customer and reseller management

The two sales channels behave differently and should be managed accordingly.
- segment customers based on purchase history, frequency, and order value
- personalize campaigns to improve retention
- provide incentives to top-performing resellers
- reassess or support underperforming resellers

## Improve operational efficiency and inventory management

Slow-moving products reveal opportunities to optimize inventory.
- adopt demand-driven stock planning
- reduce overstock and stockouts
- use clearance campaigns or bundles to move stagnant products
- monitor product life cycles and adjust strategy proactively
