# Overview

Bike World started operating in July 2017 in the bicycle industry, offering a broad product range including bikes, components, clothing, and accessories.
This project analyzes sales from July 2017 to June 2020, a period that captures both the company’s early growth stage and its international expansion.

During these three years, Bike World sold products in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

The company follows a hybrid distribution model:
- direct-to-consumer sales
- reseller sales

This approach increases market reach, diversifies revenue streams, and reduces dependence on a single channel.

The goal of this project is to turn raw transactional data into useful business insights.
The analysis focuses on four main areas:
- sales performance
- geographic expansion
- product strategy
- channel optimization

# Data Structure

The ERD illustrates how transactions, customers, products, and resellers relate to each other, giving context to the metrics used throughout the analysis.

# Key Findings

Through this analysis it is understood that when Bike World started its operations, back in 2017, the company reached a total volume of sales of 11.93 million euros, with a profit of 1.88 million euros.
In the following years, sales and profit continued to grow, however, in 2020 a decline in sales was identified, possibly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, that restricted economic activity as well as outdoor activities. The category that was mostly affected was the bike category, and since it is the most representative category in sales, the decline in demand had a great impact on the total sales.
It is also noteworthy that despite the sales decline the company's profit was not impacted, it grew when compared to 2018.
Below is the overview page from the PowerBI dashboard.

When looking at total sales by country, the United States stands out as the market with the highest volume. Canada and Australia come next, followed by the United Kingdom, France and Germany.
From a strategic point of view, relying so heavily on the United States may become a risk, as it points to a certain dependency on a single market. For this reason, expanding sales across different regions should be considered a priority. At the same time, the European market appears to offer good growth potential, especially as more consumers are shifting toward environmentally friendly commuting options.

By further exploring both commercial and transactional data, the following patterns emerged:
- product demand and revenue contribution trends
- differences between customer and reseller purchasing behavior
- operational improvement opportunities

These observations serve as the foundation for the recommendations below.


# Recommendations

## Focus on high-performing products

A large share of revenue comes from a small number of products, mainly Mountain Bikes and Road Bikes.
- increase marketing and online visibility for these products
- review low-performing items, especially clothing and accessories
- consider bundles or catalog reduction to lower inventory costs
- use upselling and cross-selling for premium models and related accessories

## Improve customer and reseller management

The two sales channels behave differently and should be managed accordingly.
- segment customers based on purchase history, frequency, and order value
- personalize campaigns to improve retention
- provide incentives to top-performing resellers
- reassess or support underperforming resellers

## Improve operational efficiency and inventory management

Slow-moving products reveal opportunities to optimize inventory.
- adopt demand-driven stock planning
- reduce overstock and stockouts
- use clearance campaigns or bundles to move stagnant products
- monitor product life cycles and adjust strategy proactively
