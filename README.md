# Overview
Bike World started operations in July 2017 and operates in the bicycle industry with a diverse product portfolio, including Bikes, Components, Clothing, and Accessories.
This project analyzes sales data from July 2017 to June 2020, capturing the company’s early growth and international expansion. During this period, Bike World sold products in the United States, Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

The company uses a hybrid distribution model, combining:
- Direct sales to customers
- Sales through resellers
This dual-channel approach helps expand market reach, diversify revenue, and strengthen overall presence.

The goal of this project is to transform raw transactional data into actionable insights. Insights and recommendations focus on four main areas:
- Sales performance
- Geographic expansion
- Product strategy
- Channel optimization

# Recommendations
Here are some actionable insights based on the sales data analysis:

## Focus on High-Performing Products
- Most revenue comes from a few top products, like Mountain Bikes and Road Bikes.
- Boost marketing and online visibility for these products to increase revenue further.
- Review low-performing items in Clothing and Accessories; reducing or bundling them could save on inventory costs.
- Try upselling or cross-selling higher-end models and related accessories to increase average order value.

## Improve Customer and Reseller Management
- Different sales channels show distinct patterns. Direct-to-consumer sales behave differently than reseller-driven sales.
- Segment customers by purchase history, frequency, and order size to tailor marketing campaigns and improve retention.
- Focus on high-performing resellers with incentives or better terms.
- For underperforming resellers, consider reassessing partnerships or providing support to boost performance.

## Boost Operational Efficiency & Inventory Management
- Slow-moving or low-margin products highlight the need for better inventory management.
- Use demand-driven inventory planning to reduce overstock and avoid stockouts.
- Consider clearance promotions or bundles to move slow products.
- Monitor product life cycles and adjust strategies proactively.
